                <p> <img src="images/mexico-city.png" alt="mexico"> Mexico City is having a moment. Just a five-hour flight from New York, Mexico City has quickly become an uber-popular weekend destination for urbanists and culture seekers alike. Long a center of anthropological history and Latin American art, a new wave of local business owners have leveraged the Mexican entrepreneurial spirit to build an irresistible culinary scene and innovative public architecture that keep this, the oldest city in the Americas, at the forefront of cultural relevance.</p>

                <p><img src="images/ny.png" alt="new york"> New York is the most ethnically diverse, religiously varied, commercially driven, famously congested, and, in the eyes of many, the most attractive urban centre in the country. No other city has contributed more images to the collective consciousness of Americans: Wall Street means finance, Broadway is synonymous with theatre, Fifth Avenue is automatically paired with shopping, Madison Avenue means the advertising industry, Greenwich Village connotes bohemian lifestyles, Seventh Avenue signifies fashion, Tammany Hall defines machine politics, and Harlem evokes images of the Jazz Age, African American aspirations, and slums. The word tenement brings to mind both the miseries of urban life and the upward mobility of striving immigrant masses. New York has more Jews than Tel Aviv, more Irish than Dublin, more Italians than Naples, and more Puerto Ricans than San Juan. Its symbol is the Statue of Liberty, but the metropolis is itself an icon, the arena in which Emma Lazarus’s “tempest-tost” people of every nation are transformed into Americans—and if they remain in the city, they become New Yorkers.</p>
